# DataStructures-Lab01
In this repository we are going to see how we can use a doubly linked list in java, in order to read a txt file(Here Tom Sawyer.txt). More specifically we have to read the txt file and store each word in a Node(if a word appears more that 1 time we increase the filed -> count).
Then we can build our main however we want it.
I provide the pdf file our professor gave(its in Greek)

I know for some of you this might be very easy but im just trying to learn and enjoy the process :)
